#INC0059304

Danna and Nicole,

Thank you for your patience. I am all following up in regards to your incident INC0059304, about Nicole's portal access. From what we have on this side Nicole has been changed to the point of contact for the portal and everything should be set for portal access.

Previously request for CPC+ access was rejected due to lack of practice ID. If we receive a new request we can approve access right away. To do this Nicole will need to login in to the CPC+ portal and request access to the CPC+ application with your specific practice ID.

As you may know this is done by selecting application console from the innovation center drop down on the main portal page. Within the application console you will need to select "Request New Access" in the CMMI request access area. Once you have done this you will need to select the "Comprehensive Pirmary Care/+" for application name and practice user for role. Finally, in the justification field please make sure it contains your necessary practice ID and submit the request. Once the request is submitted I will process access and work to resolve any issues.

Feel free to reply to this message or contact CPC+ Support at 1-888-372-3280 for any questions or walkthroughs.

Thank you,
Jacob
CPC+ Support
